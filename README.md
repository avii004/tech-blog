# tech-blog

My tech blog is hosted on a sequelize-powered MySQL database. You must first create an account in order to publish, comment, and upvote on posts. It makes use of bcrypt to improve site security by hashing the passwords. You can write new posts and browse your previous ones on the dashboard after logging in to the website. You can browse the most recent posts and leave comments on the homepage. This project is hosted by Heroku. The Heroku deployment link is located under Showcase.v
